Kaggle generally does not support downloading subfolders from an image dataset. This can be a problem when the dataset is large (several GBs) and we are only interested in a few subfolders of the dataset. 
Luckily, there is a workaround by using a notebook for a dataset like that. 
The given notebook contains the code generated with vibe coding.
